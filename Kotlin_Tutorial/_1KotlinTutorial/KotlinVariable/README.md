## Variable Declaration
Kotlin variable is declared using keyword `var` and `val`.
```kotlin
var language ="Java"  
val salary = 30000  
```

Difference between var and val
- `var (Mutable variable)`: We can change the value of variable declared using var keyword later in the program.
```kotlin
var salary = 30000  
salary = 40000 //execute  
```

- `val (Immutable variable)`: We cannot change the value of variable which is declared using val keyword.
```kotlin
val language = "Java"  
language = "Kotlin" //Error  
```
